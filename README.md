# line-search-file
A simple python app that can choose a random folder enter its file and choose a random line from it. (Made mostly for the Discord privacy package) 

# PATH
It is advised you replace the default path with the one you wish to use.

# Reverse search function
A reverse search function implements a way to search from username by checking the json file against the input, however as much as I would wish to add that function it would require a full rewrite which I don't plan to do. I am abandoning this project at least for now.
